                <p>Nepal is a landlocked country in South Asia and is bordered by China and India. It is located in the

                    minister. Nepal has a traditional economic system in which the majority of the population engages in
                    subsistence agriculture, and the allocation of available resources is made on the basis of primitive
                    methods. Nepal is a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).</p>
